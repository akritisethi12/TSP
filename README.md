This project implements the Traveling Salesman Person problem using three approaches:
  1) Genetic Algorithm
  2) Greedy Algorithm
  3) A* Algorithm

The pyevolve_decision_tree.py predicts the class for a given set of inputs by constructing a two category decision tree using
the Genetic algorithm.

To run the Genetic and Greedy algorithm approach, a pipeline is defined which can be accessed by running the 
hw4_wrapper.py file from the cmd/Terminal as below:
python hw4_wrapper.py

To run the A* algorithm, run the hw4_astar.py file as below:
python hw4_astar.py

To run the decision tree using genetic algorithm, run the pyevolve_decision_tree.py file as below:
python pyevolve_decision_tree.py
